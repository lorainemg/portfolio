This project uses the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, in particular the dataset "Individual Household Electric Power Consumption". A real example related to the electricity consumption of a house for 4 years is analyzed.

#### Summary

* The project is written in R.
* A normal population will be generated in which different samples will be extracted and their differences will be studied.
* Then, we will carry out a hypothesis test of equality of variances between two attributes of the dataset.
* In addition, a study of these data will be carried out using regression techniques, which will allow us to determine if there are linear relationships between some of the given variables.
* Then we will reduce the dimension of the data through principal component analysis (PCA), clusters and classification trees, also making an interpretation of them.
* Finally, we will carry out an analysis of variance or ANOVA to compare the means of a characteristic in several populations.

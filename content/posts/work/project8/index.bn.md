My Collection of Projects at DataCamp. This exercises are taken from the course [Associate Data Scientist in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/associate-data-scientist-in-python) from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). Here's a brief description of each project.


#### Introduction to DataCamp Projects

This notebook serves as an Introduction to DataCamp Projects.

* Introduces what a Jupyter notebook is, showing how to run code cells.
* Show how to load and show pandas DataFrames.
* Show how to show inline matplotlib plots.
* Show the interactive output of Maps.

##### Habilities

- `Data Manipulation`, `Data Visualization`, `Importing & Cleaning Data`, `Case Studies`

#### Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

In this project I apply the foundational Python skills by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data.

* Some data manipulation with Pandas is done.
* The database is loaded from a csv file.
* Matplotlib is used to show visualizations of the data.
* The films are analyzed by genre, to determine if this is correlated with its duration.

#### The GitHub History of the Scala Language

Find the true Scala experts by exploring its development history in Git and GitHub.

* We read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub).
* We find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

#### The Android App Market on Google Play

Load, clean, and visualize scraped Google Play Store data to gain insights into the Android app market.

* We do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. 
* We look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth.

#### A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

Explore a dataset from Kaggle containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates.

* The dataset is analyzed to look for biased data according to gender and nationality.
* Other analyses are carried out, including how old the winners of Nobel prizes are, the differences between price categories, the oldest and younger winners, etc.

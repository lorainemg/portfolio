### Summary

* In this repo, an Information Retrieval System based on the Vector Information Retrieval Model is implemented.
* The design of the system is exposed according to each stage of information retrieval and several of its functionalities are implemented.
* A visual interface using Streamlit is used.
* Clustering techniques to group documents and a crawler to gain information are applied.
* NLP techniques and different metrics in different collections are applied to check the functionality of the system.

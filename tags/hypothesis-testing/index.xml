&lt;p>This project uses the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, in particular the dataset &amp;ldquo;Individual Household Electric Power Consumption&amp;rdquo;. A real example related to the electricity consumption of a house for 4 years is analyzed.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The project is written in R.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A normal population will be generated in which different samples will be extracted and their differences will be studied.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then, we will carry out a hypothesis test of equality of variances between two attributes of the dataset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In addition, a study of these data will be carried out using regression techniques, which will allow us to determine if there are linear relationships between some of the given variables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then we will reduce the dimension of the data through principal component analysis (PCA), clusters and classification trees, also making an interpretation of them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally, we will carry out an analysis of variance or ANOVA to compare the means of a characteristic in several populations.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
